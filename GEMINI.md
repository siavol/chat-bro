This app uses Spec Kit: 
- The specification files are in `specs` folder.

When working with tasks:
- Do only tasks I requested explicitly. NEVER start next task until I request it.
- Mark task with `[DONE]` when it is complete and tested.
- Do NOT proceed with executing next tasks automatically.
- Let me review tests written before proceed with implementation.
