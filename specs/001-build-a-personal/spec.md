# Feature Specification: Personal AI Assistant (Telegram Bot)

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-personal`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a personal AI assistant accessible through a Telegram bot that answers my questions in natural language, remembers my preferences, and acts as an agent to provide lunch recommendations from nearby restaurants, search and retrieve documents from my personal document system, and suggest movies for family evenings with the ability to initiate downloads through my home media server, while proactively notifying me about new relevant options."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to interact with a personal AI assistant through a Telegram bot. I want to ask it questions, have it remember my preferences, and have it act as an agent to help me with tasks like finding lunch, retrieving documents, and choosing movies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have the Telegram bot open, **When** I ask "What is the capital of France?", **Then** the bot should reply with "Paris".
2. **Given** I have previously told the bot "I like Italian food", **When** I ask "Where should I go for lunch?", **Then** the bot should suggest nearby Italian restaurants.
3. **Given** the bot is connected to my document system, **When** I ask "Find my 2023 tax return", **Then** the bot should provide me with the document.
4. **Given** the bot is connected to my home media server, **When** I ask "Suggest a family movie", **Then** the bot should recommend a movie and ask if I want to download it.
5. **Given** a new highly-rated sci-fi movie is available, **When** the bot is running, **Then** it should proactively send me a message suggesting the movie.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the personal document system is offline or unreachable?
- What happens when the home media server is offline or unreachable?
- How does the system handle ambiguous requests like "Find the document"?
- What happens if the user's location is unavailable for restaurant recommendations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST be accessible through a Telegram bot interface.
- **FR-002**: System MUST understand and respond to user queries in natural language.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow a user to store, update, and delete personal preferences.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide lunch recommendations from nearby restaurants, filterable by user preferences (e.g., cuisine, price).
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide an interface to connect to and search a personal document system.
- **FR-006**: System MUST retrieve and deliver documents from the connected personal document system.
- **FR-007**: System MUST suggest movies appropriate for a family audience.
- **FR-008**: System MUST be able to initiate a download on a connected home media server.
- **FR-009**: System MUST proactively notify the user about new relevant options. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What events or data trigger proactive notifications? What defines "relevant options" (e.g., new movies matching preferences, new documents)?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle unavailability of external systems (document system, media server) gracefully by informing the user. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected behavior? Retry logic? Caching?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents the individual interacting with the assistant.
  - *Attributes*: Telegram User ID, Stored Preferences.
- **Preference**: A user-defined setting to personalize assistant behavior.
  - *Attributes*: Preference Key (e.g., "favorite_cuisine"), Preference Value (e.g., "Italian").
- **Document**: A file within the user's personal document system.
  - *Attributes*: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What metadata is available for documents (e.g., title, content, tags)?]
- **Movie**: A media file on the user's home media server.
  - *Attributes*: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What metadata is available for movies (e.g., title, genre, rating)?]
- **Restaurant**: A local dining establishment.
  - *Attributes*: Name, Location, Cuisine Type, Price Range, Rating.
